üß† MIC-1 Simulator (.NET/C#)
This project is a high-performance, event-driven emulator of the MIC-1 microprogrammed architecture as described by Andrew S. Tanenbaum in Structured Computer Organization. Implemented in modern C# under the MLDComputing.Emulators.MIC1.Core namespace, it is designed for both educational use and advanced emulation of IJVM programs with deep debugging support.

‚ú® Features
‚úÖ Fully microcoded MIC-1 execution engine with cycle-accurate simulation

‚úÖ Supports a customizable microinstruction control store with MicroCodeStoreBuilder

‚úÖ Implements Tanenbaum‚Äôs IJVM instruction set, including arithmetic, logic, branching, and stack operations

‚úÖ Accurate 32-bit stack management with big-endian layout

‚úÖ Supports execution throttling to match a real processor‚Äôs clock speed and frame rate

‚úÖ Unthrottled mode for benchmark or batch execution

‚úÖ Built-in event hooks for:

Execution start/stop

Microinstruction cycles

Performance sampling (PerfEvent)

Trap and fault handling (TrapEvent)

‚úÖ Per-instruction and per-cycle statistics gathering

‚úÖ Visual TOS management and HALT tracking

‚úÖ Extensible trap and memory protection model

üèó Architecture Highlights
Core Simulation Engine: The MIC1Simulator class manages the instruction fetch-decode-execute loop, microinstruction transitions, memory interactions, and trap conditions.

Memory Model: Supports configurable memory size with optional bounds and write protection.

Registers: Emulates MIC-1 registers including PC, SP, MAR, MDR, MBR, MPC, and the H register.

ALU Pipeline: Uses an inline ALU with condition flag tracking and JAM control logic.

Event Model: Exposes hooks for real-time execution and debugging tools to observe simulator state and flow.

üñ• Example Use
csharp
Copy
Edit
var sim = new MIC1Simulator(memorySize: 65536, targetProcessorSpeed: 1_000_000);
sim.Run(CancellationToken.None, clearState: true, pc: 0x100, bytes: bootProgram);
You can also subscribe to events:

csharp
Copy
Edit
sim.ExecutionEvent += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine($"Executed: {e.EventCode}, Cycles: {e.CycleCount}");
sim.TrapEvent += (s, e) => Console.WriteLine($"Trap: {e.TrapCode} - {e.Message}");
üìä Performance & Profiling
Targeted performance is configurable (e.g., 1 MHz emulation with 60Hz video sync)

Tracks per-opcode microcycle counts

Can output live statistics on IJVM instruction frequency and execution times

üß© Extensibility
The microcode store can be customized to support new instructions (e.g., SWAP, SETSP, DUP, etc.)

You can extend the IJVM instruction set, modify control store behavior, or implement new trap conditions

Ok can you add that it implements this instructions set so far using MLDComputing.Emulators.MIC1.Core.MicroCode;

namespace MLDComputing.Emulators.MIC1.Core.IJVM;

public enum OpCode : byte
{
    NOP = MicroInstructionCode.FETCHStartFetchDecode & 0xFF,
    
    FETCH = MicroInstructionCode.FETCHStartFetchDecode & 0xFF,

    // Push byte onto stack
    BIPUSH = MicroInstructionCode.BIPUSHCopyPCToMar & 0xFF,

    // Pop two words from stack; push their sum
    IADD = MicroInstructionCode.IADDLoadFirst & 0xFF,

    // Pop two words from stack; push their sum
    ISUB = MicroInstructionCode.ISUBLoadFirst & 0xFF,

    IAND = MicroInstructionCode.IANDLoadFirst & 0xFF,

    IOR = MicroInstructionCode.IORLoadFirst & 0xFF,

    IXOR = MicroInstructionCode.IXORLoadFirst & 0xFF,

    ISHL = MicroInstructionCode.ISHLLoadFirst & 0xFF,

    ISHR = MicroInstructionCode.ISHRLoadFirst & 0xFF,

    IUSHR = MicroInstructionCode.IUSHRLoadFirst & 0xFF,
    
    // Copy top word on stack and push onto stack
    DUP = MicroInstructionCode.DUPLoadTopAddress & 0xFF,

    // Unconditional Branch
    GOTO = MicroInstructionCode.GOTOInit & 0xFF,

    // Branch IF Eq to Zero
    IFEQ = MicroInstructionCode.IFEQLoadTop & 0xFF,
    

    IFNE = MicroInstructionCode.IFNELoadTop & 0xFF,
    
    // Reserved for Extension Instructions

    // Set Stack Pointer High Byte and Low Byte
    SETSP = MicroInstructionCode.SETSPLoadHigh & 0xFF,

    POP = MicroInstructionCode.POPIncrementSP & 0xFF,
    
    SWAP = MicroInstructionCode.POPIncrementSP & 0xFF,
    
    // Terminate execution of machine
    HALT = MicroInstructionCode.HALT & 0xFF,
    
    // Pseudo Instruction for Managing the TOS
    TOS = MicroInstructionCode.ReloadTOSSetMAR,

Certainly! Here's an updated version of the README introduction with a section that explicitly lists the currently implemented IJVM instruction set, based on your OpCode enum under MLDComputing.Emulators.MIC1.Core.IJVM.
